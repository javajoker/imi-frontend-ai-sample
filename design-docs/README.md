# IP Marketplace Infrastructure - Complete Project Documentation

## 🏗️ Project Overview

The IP Marketplace Infrastucture is a comprehensive system that enables intellectual property creators to license their work, secondary creators to build products using licensed IP, and buyers to purchase verified products. The platform consists of two main applications:

1. **Admin Dashboard** - Management interface for platform administrators
2. **Marketplace Platform** - User-facing marketplace for creators and buyers

## 🎯 Platform Features

### Core Business Logic

#### 1. IP Registration & Licensing
- **IP Creators** can register their intellectual property
- Set licensing terms (revenue share percentage, license fee, usage guidelines)
- Define qualification requirements for licensees
- Track licensing revenue and usage analytics

#### 2. Secondary Creation System
- **Secondary Creators** can browse and apply for IP licenses
- Create products using licensed intellectual property
- Automatic revenue sharing with original IP creators
- License verification ensures authentic products

#### 3. Multi-level Creation Chain
- Support for re-creation based on secondary creations
- Infinite creation chains with proper attribution
- Revenue sharing cascades through the creation hierarchy

#### 4. Authorization & Verification
- **Automatic license verification** for all products
- **License revocation system** - licensors can revoke licenses for violations
- **Authorization history tracking** - maintain permanent records
- **Genuine product certification** - buyers can verify authenticity

### User Roles & Capabilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API server running on port 3001

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone and Setup Backend service
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd imi/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API settings

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### 2. Setup Frontend Web App
```bash
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API settings

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration
```env
# .env file for both applications
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
VITE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=10485760
VITE_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES=en,zhTW
```

## 📊 Data Flow & API Integration

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in through marketplace platform
2. JWT token stored in local storage
3. Token included in API requests for authentication
4. Admin dashboard has separate admin authentication

### IP Creation & Licensing Flow
1. **Creator registers IP** → API validates and stores IP data
2. **Secondary creator applies for license** → Application sent to IP creator
3. **Creator approves/rejects** → License status updated
4. **Approved license enables product creation** → Secondary creator gains access
5. **Products created** → Automatic license verification
6. **Sales generate revenue** → Automatic revenue sharing

### Revenue Sharing Algorithm
```javascript
// Example revenue sharing calculation
const calculateRevenueShare = (saleAmount, licenseChain) => {
  let remainingAmount = saleAmount;
  const platformFee = saleAmount * 0.05; // 5% platform fee
  remainingAmount -= platformFee;
  
  // Distribute revenue through the license chain
  licenseChain.forEach(license => {
    const shareAmount = remainingAmount * (license.shareRate / 100);
    // Transfer to license holder
    transferRevenue(license.creator, shareAmount);
    remainingAmount -= shareAmount;
  });
  
  // Remaining amount goes to direct seller
  return remainingAmount;
};
```
